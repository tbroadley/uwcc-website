        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          UWCC was initiated in Fall 2012 as &quot;University of Waterloo Compost Coalition&quot; and was established
          by Joshua Jodoin and a team of Environment students. In 2013, the project was passed on to
          four other students, Kevin Rotseart, Clover Mei, Mike Hager, and Brandon Caron, who continued
          the research and groundwork for the eventual launch of the program.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2014, Brandon, Clover, and Mike established the executive team along with Andres Rodriguez
          and Monique Yu. They re-launched the project as &quot;University of Waterloo Campus Compost&quot; as
          the group had evolved significantly since initial conception. To date, our 100% student-run
          composting operation is perhaps the most unique among all Canadian post-secondary institutions.
          In 2014 and 2015, UWCC acquired two compost drums (affectionately referred to as compost cows)
          from Actium Composting and initiated the first year of operations, which ultimately resulted
          in success and nearly 2,200 pounds of diverted organic waste. Within this pilot year, UWCC also
          joined Sustainable Campus Initiative as an ongoing project to help further establish
          the group's ties and voice support for all on-campus green initiatives.
        </p>

        <p>
          UWCC has shown tremendous growth over the years. Currently, UWCC provides composting services
           to over 25 locations in faculty offices, food services, and coffee shops as well as various
           events. We have also collaborated with orientation leaders by providing services to
           selected events during Orientation Week. UWCC is continually seeking the best way to
           maximize our capacity each term, and we appreciate the help of all volunteers who have
           helped us come this far. In recent terms, we have also been shifting our focus towards
           education and advocacy initiatives to spread awareness about composting.

        <h2>Our Teams</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Operations</h3>
            <p>The operations team is a group of dedicated volunteers who have accepted the
              responsibility of transforming our ideas into actions. These volunteers ensure that
              compost is collected 2-3 times a week from our locations as well as record
              observations and data regarding the quantity and quality of material in our bins.
              In addition, they also transfer organic material and shredded paper into our compost
              cows and monitor the progress of the compost process by regularly checking temperatures
               and turning the cows. Since the operations team is the most dominant aspect of our
               activities on-campus, the growth of our organization heavily depends on this group
               of passionate volunteers. Aside from our day-to-day operations, this team is also
               responsible for the maintenance of an appropriate carbon-nitrogen ratio as well
               as data management.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Marketing</h3>
            <p>The marketing team collaborates closely with the operations team as well as the
              organization's executive team to facilitate the growth of UWCC through the engagement
              of various stakeholders. The purpose of the marketing team is to generate public
              interest in waste reduction through composting, educate and advocate for the benefits
               of composting, and promote other UW student initiatives toward sustainability as well.
               Through the use of social media, posters, awareness campaigns, events, and
               collaborations with other groups, the team works to increase the visibility
               of the organization on-campus.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Membership</h3>
            <p>In addition to the operations and marketing teams, UWCC also has a small membership
              team that is responsible for overseeing successful volunteer recruitment, management,
              and retention as well as other human resources initiatives. Currently, the membership
              team only consists of executive members, but as we grow, there may be a need for a
              larger membership team for UWCC.</p>
